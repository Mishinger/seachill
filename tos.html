    <h1>🌴 SeaChill terms & conditions</h1>

    <p>Welcome to SeaChill – your relaxing companion for tracking sea temperatures and enjoying the ocean responsibly.</p>
    <p>By using SeaChill, you need to follow these rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>🌴 Copying</strong> - You can make your custom sea app based on SeaChill, but it must be free and please give a small shout-out to the OG SeaChill.</li>
      <li><strong>🌊 Respect</strong> - Use SeaChill responsibly and respect local guidelines and nature when enjoying the sea.</li>
      <li><strong>🏄‍♂️ Health & safety</strong> - SeaChill is just for fun and info, not for emergencies or life-saving. Please use your own judgment and stay safe out there — always follow local rules and be careful in and around the sea. We’re not responsible for any mishaps, so take care and enjoy responsibly!</li>
      <li><strong>⛈ Updates</strong> - this may get updated, but I'll tell you about major changes to the rules beforehand.</li>
      <li><strong>🧭 Not fully accurate</strong> - the data may not be 100% perfect, so it isn't our fault if there is sunny weather in the forecast and then rain comes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have privacy concerns, go back to the about page to read about the privacy. Spoiler alert - no tracking</p>
